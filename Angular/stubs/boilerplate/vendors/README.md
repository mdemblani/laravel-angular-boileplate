Vendors
=======

Any 3rd party/open-source or your own external library code, that do not provide an ES-6
import/export in their code should be present over here. The code after being moved over-here should be
wrapped in an ES-6 style import/export statements to be easily used in your application.

To access code present in a Vendor library, you can use the following syntax
`import moduleName from 'vendors/file-name';
